We revisited the Text-Based Ideal Point Model (TBIP)! TBIP ([Vafa et al., 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.475/)) is a probabilistic topic model for estimating ideologies using word-choice differences on shared topics, we explored its potential in multiparty contexts! See our [paper](https://github.com/dapivei/ideal-point-texts/blob/main/revisiting-tbip.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/dapivei/ideal-point-texts).
