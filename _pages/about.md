I am a second year master in data science at [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu), working with [Prof. Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com) in the [Agentic Learning AI Lab](https://agenticlearning.ai) and [Prof. Krzysztof J. Geras](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kgeras). My research interests include understanding LLMs (capabilities and limitations) and AI in healthcare. Recently, my work includes evaluating the generalization ability of LLMs and multi-modal learning for breast cancer detection.

Previously, I completed my BS in Statistics at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Outside of school, I also do hiphop dancing!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
